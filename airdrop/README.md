# DMZAirdrop

The airdrop contract helps to airdrop tokens using merkle tree distributor.

 * **Claim** - Claim the designated amount of tokens from the distributor
 * claim (Claim) - Address of the receiver, amount to be redeemed and the leaves of the proof of the merkle tree for the address.
 * **RevokeOwnership** - Revoke the ownership transfer for any address.
 * **TransferOwnership** - Owner only transition to change owner. 
 * - new_owner (ByStr20) - new owner address
 * **AcceptOwnership** - New contract owner can accept the ownership transfer request.
 * **RedeemTokens** - Redeem leftover tokens by the admin from the distributor
 * - amount (Uint128) - Number of tokens to be redeemed

contract DMZAirdrop
  TransferOwnership(new_owner: ByStr20)

  AcceptOwnership()
  RedeemTokens(amount: Uint128)
```

## Callbacks
```Ocaml
contract DMZAirdrop
  RecipientAcceptTransfer(
  sender : ByStr20,
